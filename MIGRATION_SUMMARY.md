# Migration Summary: coenttb-com-server Architectural Refactoring

## Quick Reference

This is the executive summary for the comprehensive architectural refactoring of coenttb-com-server, applying lessons learned from building repotraffic-com-server.

---

## What's Changing

### 1. **Mono-repo Architecture** ⭐ Most Important
Moving from multi-repository structure to a single mono-repo:

**Before:**
```
coenttb/
├── coenttb-com-server/          (main app)
└── coenttb-com-shared/          (separate repo)
```

**After:**
```
coenttb/
└── coenttb-com-server/          (everything in one repo)
```

### 2. **Domain-Driven Design**
Reorganizing code by business domains with Interface/Live pattern:

**Before:**
- Server Client (generic)
- Server Database (generic)
- Server Models (generic)
- Server Integration (mixed concerns)

**After:**
- Blog / BlogLive
- Newsletter / NewsletterLive
- Account / AccountLive
- Content / ContentLive
- Email / EmailLive
- CoenttbRecords (shared database)
- CoenttbUI (shared UI)
- CoenttbRouter (routing)

### 3. **Database Layer**
Migrating from Fluent ORM to swift-records:

**Before:** Fluent with class-based models
**After:** Records with @Table structs and StructuredQueries

### 4. **Platform Upgrade**
**Before:** Swift 6.1.0, macOS 14
**After:** Swift 6.2, macOS 15

### 5. **Enhanced Documentation**
Adding comprehensive docs:
- DOMAIN_ARCHITECTURE.md
- ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md
- Improved CLAUDE.md
- Development scripts

---

## Why These Changes

### Problems with Current Architecture

1. **Multi-repo Complexity**
   - Requires managing two repositories
   - Complex dependency versioning
   - Harder to make atomic changes
   - Slower development iteration

2. **Generic Module Names**
   - "Server Client" doesn't indicate what it does
   - "Server Integration" mixes concerns
   - Hard to navigate codebase

3. **Mixed Concerns**
   - Business logic mixed with infrastructure
   - Hard to test components in isolation
   - Unclear dependencies between modules

4. **Limited Type Safety**
   - Fluent uses classes (not Sendable)
   - Runtime database queries
   - Limited compile-time guarantees

### Benefits of New Architecture

1. **Simplified Development**
   - ✅ Single repository to clone
   - ✅ Atomic commits across "shared" code
   - ✅ No package publishing/versioning overhead

2. **Clear Organization**
   - ✅ Code organized by business domain
   - ✅ Easy to find relevant code
   - ✅ Self-documenting structure

3. **Better Testability**
   - ✅ Interface/Live pattern enables mocking
   - ✅ Dependencies are explicit
   - ✅ Can test domains in isolation

4. **Modern Swift**
   - ✅ Swift 6.2 strict concurrency
   - ✅ Type-safe database queries
   - ✅ Sendable throughout
   - ✅ Actor isolation where needed

5. **Scalability**
   - ✅ Easy to add new domains
   - ✅ Clear patterns to follow
   - ✅ Modular architecture

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Repository Consolidation (2-4 hours)

**Goal:** Merge coenttb-com-shared into coenttb-com-server

**Steps:**
1. Copy shared code into server repo
2. Update Package.swift to use internal targets
3. Update all import statements
4. Test & commit

**Output:**
- ✅ Single repository
- ✅ No external coenttb-com-shared dependency
- ✅ All tests pass

**Risk:** Low
**Complexity:** Low

---

### Phase 2: Domain Extraction (1-2 weeks)

**Goal:** Reorganize code by business domains with Interface/Live pattern

**Domains to Create:**
- Blog / BlogLive
- Newsletter / NewsletterLive
- Account / AccountLive
- Content / ContentLive
- Email / EmailLive
- Legal
- Analytics / AnalyticsLive

**Shared Modules:**
- CoenttbRecords (database models)
- CoenttbUI (UI components & translations)
- CoenttbRouter (routing)

**Steps:**
1. For each domain:
   - Create Interface target (domain models & client)
   - Create Live target (implementation)
   - Create Tests target
   - Extract code from old modules
   - Update Package.swift

2. Remove old generic modules:
   - ServerClient
   - ServerModels
   - ServerIntegration
   - ServerDependencies
   - ServerTranslations

3. Rename executables:
   - Server → coenttb_com

**Output:**
- ✅ Domain-driven structure
- ✅ Interface/Live separation

5. Update database configuration
6. Remove Fluent dependency
7. Test thoroughly

**Output:**
- ✅ All models are Records @Table structs
