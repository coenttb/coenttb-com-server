# From broke to building in Swift

Welcome to my personal blog. I'm Coen ten Thije Boonkkamp, and this is my digital playground where I share all things law, code, startups, winsâ€”and yes, even failures.

## My Journey (So Far)

As a law student, I launched a legal tech startup, quickly realizing that living inside Microsoft Word forever wasn't exactly my dream. But reality hit hardâ€”I went broke and spent two humbling months on social welfare. Eventually, I landed a job at the leading Dutch trust office at the timeâ€”a challenging experience, to say the least. Letâ€™s just say: not exactly birthday-party anecdotes.

Undeterred, I dove back into startups, this time supported by UtrechtInc. The community was fantastic and provided solid entrepreneurial lessons. Could I have made more of it? Probably. But then COVID struck, flipping my startup upside down and pushing me once again toward bankruptcy.

I pressed reset and returned to law. Joining Liance was a game changerâ€”I found myself thriving, advising innovative life sciences projects, and significantly leveling up professionally. It was exactly the platform I needed. Today, Iâ€™m independent again, advising fascinating initiatives like the [100+ Study at Amsterdam UMC](https://100plus.nl), the [Alzheimer Genetics Hub](https://alzheimergenetics.org), and the [DEMENTREE Biobank](https://www.alzheimercentrum.nl/wetenschap/lopend-onderzoek/biobank-dementree/).

## A Lawyer Who Codes

Oh, and programming. Can't forget that. I stumbled upon Swift early on and discovered its power for writing clear legal business logic. Following classic startup adviceâ€”"build and launch quickly"â€”I created a legal tech app, only to learn an inconvenient truth: no one wants legal tech on mobile. Seriously, no one.

Pivoting to the web was the logical next step, but hereâ€™s the catchâ€”I stubbornly insisted on writing the site in Swift. Letâ€™s just say, building an elegant website purely in Swift is a challenge. Did I mention I value elegance in code? To me, writing elegant code is akin to crafting art, and trust me, elegant code is not easily achieved.

Thankfully, the brilliant folks at [PointFree](https://www.pointfree.co) showed me the light. I've been a subscriber since 2018, and their content is nothing short of phenomenal. Their functional programming approach is undeniably superiorâ€”clean, maintainable, elegant. But outside their open-source website, real-world examples of Swift-driven sites were scarce.

## Open-Sourcing coenttb.com: A Swift Vapor Journey Inspired by PointFree

Developing a website with Swift is exhilarating, clean, yet incredibly challenging. Drawing inspiration from PointFreeâ€™s functional elegance, I set out to build **coenttb.com** using Swift and Vapor. The journey was profoundly rewarding, yet peppered with headaches. Front-end dynamics? Definitely still a work in progress (any Swift WASM experts around? Letâ€™s connect!). Writing maintainable, elegant code? Surprisingly tough when swimming against the tide of HTML/CSS/JS conventions.

So, Iâ€™m open-sourcing **coenttb.com**.

Why open source? Starting from scratch is overrated, and if I can spare others the headaches I faced, itâ€™s worth it. Whether you're passionate about Swift or just curious about web development in Swift, this is your invitation.

My goals are simple:
1. Demonstrate elegant structuring of a Swift Vapor site.
2. Save you from tedious trial-and-error.
3. Collect your invaluable feedback to improve continuously.

Swift for web development isnâ€™t the easy route, but itâ€™s undeniably rewarding when done right. Join meâ€”explore, learn, fork, contribute. Let's make something elegant together.
