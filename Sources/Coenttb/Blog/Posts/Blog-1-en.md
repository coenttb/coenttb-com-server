# From broke to building in public: open-sourcing coenttb.com

Welcome to my personal blog. I'm Coen ten Thije Boonkkamp, and this where I want to feel free to share any and all thoughts. Law. Code. Startups. Wins (and failures). I want to write about it all. 

## A bit about me

Built a legal tech startup as a student and discovered I didn't want to work in Word for the rest of my life. However, I went broke and spend two months on social welfare. I landed a job at the premier Dutch trust office at that timeâ€”*a character-building* chapter I canâ€™t legally talk freely about, but letâ€™s just say: not birthday-party material. 
 
Tried my hand at another startupâ€”this time with UtrechtInc. Great community and solid teachings for most startups. Could I have gotten more out of it? Probably. But then COVID hit, the world flipped upside down, and I found myself staring down bankruptcy. Again.
 
Hit reset and went back to my fallback: legal work. Joined Liance and thrived, advising cutting-edge life science projects and leveling up professionally. It was the launchpad I needed, but now Iâ€™m doing my own thing again, working on some amazing projects like the [100+ study of Amsterdam UMC](https://100plus.nl), the [Alzheimer Genetics Hub](https://alzheimergenetics.org), and the [DEMENTREE biobank](https://www.alzheimercentrum.nl/wetenschap/lopend-onderzoek/biobank-dementree/).

## A Lawyer Who Codes

Oh, and programming. Almost forgot to mention that. I discovered the Swift programming language early on and realized it was perfect for writing legal business logic. Naturally, I followed the classic advice: "Launch an app quickly!" So, I built a legal tech app... only to learn that *no one* uses mobile apps for legal tech. Like, seriously, itâ€™s just not a thing normies do.

So, I pivoted to a website. But hereâ€™s the catch: Iâ€™m stubborn. I didnâ€™t want to write HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. I wanted to write *Swift*. Turns out, writing an elegant website in Swift is *hard*. Did I mention I love elegant code? Itâ€™s like art to me, and writing elegant code is anything but easy.

Thankfully, the folks at [PointFree](https://www.pointfree.co) came to the rescue. Iâ€™ve been a subscriber since 2018, and their content is pure gold. Their approach is provably the bestâ€”clean, functional, and elegant. But thereâ€™s a catch: aside from their (open-source) website, there are *no good examples* of Swift websites in action.

## Open Sourcing coenttb.com: A Swift Vapor Website Inspired by PointFree  

Building a website in Swift? Itâ€™s *fun*. Itâ€™s *clean*. Itâ€™s also *painful*. Inspired by the functional elegance of [PointFree](https://www.pointfree.co), I set out to build **coenttb.com** using Swift and Vapor. The journey? Rewardingâ€”but full of headaches. Dynamic front-end? Still a work in progress (any Swift WASM wizards out there? Letâ€™s talk!). Writing elegant, maintainable code? Harder than it looks when you're swimming against the HTML/CSS/JS tide.

So hereâ€™s the deal: Iâ€™m open-sourcing **coenttb.com**.

Why? Because starting from scratch is overrated, and Iâ€™d rather help others skip the headaches Iâ€™ve endured. Whether you're a Swift nerd or just curious about using Swift for web dev, this is for you.

Hereâ€™s what I hope to do:  
1. Show how to structure a Swift Vapor website *elegantly*.
2. Save you the trial-and-error grind.
3. Get feedback to make it even better.

Swift for web dev isnâ€™t the easy path, but itâ€™s a rewarding one when done right. If youâ€™re on this journey too, check out the code, learn, fork, contributeâ€”whatever floats your boat.
